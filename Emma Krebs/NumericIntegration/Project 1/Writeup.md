# Numeric Integration

## Languages, Libraries, Lessons Learned

The primary language for this assignment was Python where we used the libraries scipy, numpy, and pandas. We have consistenly worked in Python from the beginning of this module to the final project. The pandas library was especially useful in creating tables and organizing information. I also learned how to create subplots. I knew you could make a 2x2 grid of plots, but I didn't know you could make sizes up to 4x4 so that was neat. 

## Timekeeping

As of 2/17/26, I have spent 15 hours or so on this project. 

## Summary of Code

Trapezoid section





-Talk about trapezoid function and how it is better than left and right point methods but not as good as simpsons rule. Number of subsections, what the equation looks like and why, etc. Maybe include a plot comparing how fast they both reach the summation.

-Also, need to talk about approximator function and how you determined the cut off for error with that new slideshow you found (maybe include image of the function?).

Gaussian Quadrature

-Talk about use of gaussian quadrature (honeslty not sure whhere to use this two functions as of right now...)
-Talk about how it maps to -1 to 1 and why we care
-You will probably add more to this after doing the challenege section.

Legendre Polynomials
-Talk about use of

Cricket/Cordell recommending how to make 4x4 subplot table look better. Dr. Reid is also another contributor after I stole your code from the project's markdown file to make my header look nice.
