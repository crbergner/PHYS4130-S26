# Diffusion Limited Aggregation

After that extensive dive on numeric analysis, here's a neat exploration to tackle next.

This project will use Monte Carlo methods to study a physical system.
We don't need to worry about the underlying physics at all (for now).
Imagine that a large number of small solid particles are suspended in a fluid, moving around randomly due to thermal motions ("Brownian motion").
In the center of the region is a cluster of these particles, all stuck together.
Whenever a new particle touches the cluster, it sticks to it.
As that cluster grows, how can we quantify its shape?[^3]

## Literature

It all started with 
[Diffusion-Limited Aggregation, a Kinetic Critical Phenomenon (1981 PRL)](https://journals.aps.org/prl/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevLett.47.1400)

There has been a *lot* of work since then, but this is already a little overkill.

# The Assignment

## Generative AI

> [!IMPORTANT]
> You may _not_ use generative AI on the code or on the writeup.

## The Deadline

### Rough Draft
> [!IMPORTANT]
> 3pm on April 9
> You should have
> 1. Code to generate a DLA figure for $N=100$. More is better, but this is a minimum.
> 2. An outline for your writeup. Include placeholder figures that you *want* to have in the final version.

### Final Draft
> [!IMPORTANT]
> 2pm on April 23
> This is 1 hour before the beginning of class.

## Program specification:

 - You program should model aggregation of  **N**: _a specified number_ of randomly diffusing particles
 - Start with a seed particle at the origin, and introduce particles one-by-one
 - Move that particle randomly on the lattice (one step at at time) until it is adjacent to the seed or a previous particle that is stuck to the seed
 - Your program needs **S**: a "stickyness" factor (0,1] that determines whether the particle sticks to the aggregate at that point
 - If the particle sticks, introduce a new particle. If it does not stick, continue its diffusive motion until it does

> [!NOTE]
> Convergence, stability, and error are key concepts in this course.
>  - Will the algorithm described above always terminate?
>  - What happens if the particle diffuses away from the cluster?

> [!NOTE]
> Your program should be able to generate images of the aggregate at predetermined intervals.
> You can use this to generate animations without having to have tens of thousands of frames.

> [!TIP]
> This algorithm should not be parallelized!


## The Writeup

### Address the following questions in your writeup
 1. What is the difference between capacity dimension[^1] and topological dimension?
 2. Can you replicate Witten and Sander's published capacity dimension?
 3. How does the capacity dimension change as a function of *S*?

### Attribution
What resources did you use on this assignment? People, websites, books, etc.

### Timekeeping
How long did you spend on this assignment? If you didn't keep an accurate log, an estimate is fine.

### Languages, Libraries, Lessons Learned
 1. What language did you use for your submission? Is it the same one you started using? If not, why'd you change?
 2. What libraries did you use in your submission? Were any of them remarkable? Great to use, super annoying to use, etc?

> [!NOTE]
> This section probably shouldn't more than a few sentences long. Record what you learned and move on!

# The Submission
> [!IMPORTANT]
> Your submissions for this project should be located within this project's directory. You'll have a lot of different "code" and "writeup" directories before all is said and done!

## Code directory
A directory titled "code" that contains your program files and makefile (if used), or a ReadMe.md file that gives sufficiently detailed instructions for me to build and execute your code.

> [!NOTE]
> If you test your code in a Jupyter Notebook, you will need to work to make sure your commit history is legible. I recommend a standalone code file.


## Writeup directory
A directory titled "writeup" containing 
 1. your writeup file: a well-structured markdown file OR a LaTeX document (and its resulting PDF) OR a well-structured Jupyter notebook
 2. Animation(s) of your DLA structures as they grow[^2]
 3. Figures (static, PNG or PDF) of the following
    1. Two noteworthy DLA structures of at least  5e3 particles, and a plot of their fractal dimension as a function of radius
    2. A plot of capacity dimension vs S
 4. Extensions (a.k.a. challenge)
    - Generate a 30 second long DLA animation for $N=1e6$ particles.
    - How does the behavior change with a 2D triangular lattice, where each point has six neighbors instead of four?
    - How does the behavior change in 3D, where each point has six nearest neighbors instead of four?

> [!NOTE]
> If you implement a 3D triangular lattice, each point has 12 neighbors.
> This is not required, or even suggested.

> [!NOTE]  
> This writeup will need to have figures. It's probably easiest to just add those files to your writeup directory and link them with relative markdown links.

> [!TIP]
> Your figures need to be captioned, which is probably easiest to accomplish with the [FigCaption](https://www.w3schools.com/tags/tag_figcaption.asp) attribute.

# Grading
 1. Explanation of undergirding theory
 2. Quality of workflow (including commit history)
 3. Documented implementation of relevant algorithms
 4. Clear and professional presentation of work

> [!TIP]
> You can access this markdown source file and learn from its formatting to improve your work
