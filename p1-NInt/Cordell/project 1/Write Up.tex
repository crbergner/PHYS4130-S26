\section{Attribution}
Numeric integrations NBs.

\section{Timekeeping}
Approx values

Sunday: 2 hours\\
I defined most of the functions I would need for the project and implemented the Trapezoid rule. Then I set up LaTeX.

Monday: 0 hours

Tuesday: 1.25 hours\\
I worked on figuring out how to use github.

Wednesday: 2.5 hours\\
I implemented the Gaussian quadrature and plotted the Legendre polynomials.

Thursday: 1 hour\\
Write up.

\section{Languages, Libraries, Lessons Learned}
I wrote all of my code in python from start to finish. I tried my best to mostly work in code.py 
so it would be easier to interpret my github commits, but I also used Code\_NB.py for the quality 
of life that a notebook offers when it comes to things like debugging and running a segment of 
code at a time. I also implemented various math functions from the numpy library such as np.sin, 
np.abs (absolute value), and np.sum. I used pylab for plotting. Both of these libraries are pretty 
standard because of their usefulness and simplicity, and I was already fairly familiar with them. 
In addition, I used the scipy library as instructed for Legendre polynomials. I would consider this 
pretty remarkable as I did not have to calculate them myself which would be a pain. Meanwhile, 
numpy and pylab are pretty remarkable in their own way--- they come in handy very often.

  \caption{There are 16 subplots of Legendre polynomials \(P_{i}\), \(P_{j}\), and \(P_{i} \cdot P_{j}\) for i and j in the range 1-4. The area under the curve can be observed for 
  each of the i=j subplots on the diagonal as well as the i \(\neq\) j subplots off diagonal. The areas under the i = j curves look to be approximately 1. Meanwhile, the areas under the i 
  \(\neq\) j seem to be about 0. This is the visualization of the integral of \(P_{i} \cdot P_{j}\) from -1 to 1 equals the kroenecker delta function.}
