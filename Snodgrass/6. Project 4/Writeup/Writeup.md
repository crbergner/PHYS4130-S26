# **Diffusion Limited Aggregation**

# Introduction

Diffusion-Limited Aggregation (**DLA**) is a stochastic growth process that produces fractal structures through the repeated deposition of randomly moving particles. The concept was first introduced by [Witten and Sander (1981)](./Extras/Witten&Sanders.pdf), DLA provides a model for pattern formation in systems where movement is dominated by diffusion and particle attachment occurs upon contact. Despite its simplicity, the model captures essential features observed in a wide range of physical phenomena, including electrodeposition, dielectric breakdown, viscous fingering, and cluster growth in colloidal suspensions. The resulting aggregates are complex, branched structures [Figure 1], which make them an interesting subject for studying fractal geometry and scaling behavior.

In this project, a Monte Carlo simulation is used to model DLA on a discrete lattice. Particles are introduced one at a time and undergo random walks that approximate *Brownian motion*. When a particle steps to a coordinate adjacent to an existing cluster particle, it may irreversibly attach, contributing to the growth of the aggregate. Then, the next particle is introduced, and the process repeats. This implementation extends the classical DLA model by introducing a *stickiness parameter* $( S \in (0,1] )$, which probabilistically governs whether a particle *sticks* to the cluster upon contact. This modification allows for exploration of how varying the attachment probability influences the morphology of the clusters. The simulation is designed to generate visualizations of the cluster growth at predetermined intervals, enabling qualitative assessment of the evolving structure.

A central objective of this study is to quantify the geometry of the resulting aggregates. Unlike regular *Euclidean objects*, DLA clusters exhibit fractal behavior, meaning their structure is self-similar across scales and cannot be characterized by an integer dimension. Instead, the system is analyzed using the *capacity (box-counting) dimension* and the *topological dimension*.

- Euclidean objects are fundamental geometric shapes that can be described by integer dimensions, such as points, lines, planes, and solids. 
- Self-similarity is a property where a structure appears the same, or similar, at different scales. Meaning that zooming in on a portion of the structure reveals a smaller version of the whole. 
- The capacity dimension is a measure of the complexity of a *strange attractor*, which quantifies how the number of boxes needed to cover the cluster scales with the size of the boxes.
- The topological dimension is a fundamental property describing the intrinsic dimensionality of a space (e.g., a curve is one-dimensional, a surface is two-dimensional), independent of scaling behavior.

The simulation framework developed here enables direct computation of the capacity dimension through box-counting methods, as well as a radial analysis of mass scaling. These tools allow for comparison with the canonical result reported by Witten and Sander, who found a fractal dimension of approximately $(D \approx 1.65)$ for two-dimensional DLA. Reproducing this result serves as a validation of the numerical model.

In addition to replication, this work investigates how the capacity dimension varies as a function of the stickiness parameter $(S)$. Lower values of $(S)$ introduce additional stochasticity in the attachment process, potentially leading to denser, less branched aggregates. Understanding this relationship provides insight into how microscopic interaction rules influence macroscopic morphology. This project demonstrates how relatively simple probabilistic rules can give rise to complex emergent structures, and how computational methods can be used to characterize their properties.

# Methodology

## Overview 

The Diffusion-Limited Aggregation (DLA) simulation was implemented in Python using an object-oriented approach. A single class, `DLA`, encapsulates all data structures and algorithms required to simulate particle diffusion, aggregation, and post-processing analysis. This design improves modularity, readability, and extensibility, allowing individual components of the simulation to be modified or analyzed independently. The class structure implementation is by far the biggest improvement in coding style compared to previous projects in this class. 

The following sections provide a detailed explanation of the key *methods* used in the 'DLA' class. Each method is described in terms of its purpose, inputs, outputs, and the underlying algorithms. The methods are organized according to their role in the simulation process, starting with initialization and particle motion, followed by cluster evolution and fractal analysis.

## Class Structure

### `__init__(self, stickiness, max_particles)`

This method initializes the simulation environment and key parameters:

- **Grid construction**: A square lattice is created using a NumPy array. Its size is determined dynamically based on the expected fractal dimension $( D \approx 1.65 )$ and the total number of particles $(N)$, using the scaling relation $R \sim N^{1/D}$.
- **Seed placement**: The initial particle is placed at the center of the grid.
- **Simulation parameters**:
  - `stickiness`: $( S \in (0,1] )$ Probability parameter  controlling adhesion.
  - `max_particles`: Total number of particles to be aggregated.
  - `max_steps`: Upper bound on the number of steps a particle may take before being reset.
- **Cluster tracking**:
  - A list of particle coordinates is maintained.
  - The cluster radius is updated dynamically to reflect growth.
- **Kill radius**:
  - A boundary beyond which particles are considered lost and reinitialized.

## Particle Introduction and Motion

### `new_particle(self)`

Generates a new particle on a circular boundary surrounding the current cluster. When the cluster is small (e.g., just the seed particle), this method effectively spawns particles uniformly around the center - on an equipotential surface. As the cluster grows, the method continues to introduce particles at a fixed distance from the cluster edge, ensuring that they start their random walk from a reasonable location. For small enough `max_particles`, this method is sufficient to produce a well-formed cluster. However, for larger `max_particles`, the cluster grows large enough that one or more **branches** start to form. In this case, the particles are more likely to stick to the branches and increase the growth rate of those branches, leading to anisotropic growth. 

The root cause of this problem is the *tight* spawning radius. A tight spawn radius helps the code run efficiently, but can lead to biased growth. This problem was discussed by Witten and Sander in the original paper. The solution involves Laplace's equation and finding an equipotential line/surface for particle introduction. The goal is to remove the bias introduced by the tight spawning radius. However, that method can be computationally expensive and difficult to implement.

The implementation in *this project* avoids this problem by introducing a method of tracking the **angular density** of particles in the cluster. This method computes a histogram of particle density as a function of the angle from the cluster center. The angular density is then used to bias the spawning of new particles, preferentially introducing them in less populated directions to encourage more isotropic growth. The implementation of this method is described in the `compute_angular_density` section below.

The method proceeds as follows:

1. The angular density histogram is computed using `compute_angular_density()`, which returns both the normalized histogram and the corresponding bin centers.
    - ```python
      hist, bin_centers = self.compute_angular_density()
      ```

2. The bias for spawning new particles is calculated based on the angular density. Less populated angles are given higher weights to encourage growth in those directions. Then the weights are normalized to form a valid probability distribution for random sampling.
    - ```python
      weights  = (1 - hist)**2 
      weights /= np.sum(weights) 
      ```

3. A random angle bin is selected based on the computed weights, and the spawn angle $\theta$ is set to the center of the selected bin.
    - ```python
      idx   = np.random.choice(len(bin_centers), p=weights)
      theta = bin_centers[idx]
      ```

4. A random offset within the bin is added to determine the final angle for particle introduction.
    - ```python
      bin_width = bin_centers[1] - bin_centers[0]
      theta    += random.uniform(-bin_width/2, bin_width/2)
      ```

5. The particle is placed at a radius slightly larger than the current cluster radius.
    - ```python
      radius = self.cluster_radius + 5  # Buffer distance
      x = int(self.center[0] + radius * np.cos(theta))
      y = int(self.center[1] + radius * np.sin(theta))
      ```

---

### `step(self, x, y)`

Implements a single step of the random walk:

- A direction is chosen uniformly from the 8 neighboring lattice directions (including diagonals).
  - ```python
    direction = random.choice([(1,0),(-1,0),(0,1),(0,-1),(1,1),(1,-1),(-1,1),(-1,-1)])
    ```
- The particle position is updated accordingly.
  - ```python
    return x + direction[0], y + direction[1]
    ```

This approximates isotropic diffusion on a discrete lattice.

---

### `walk(self)`

Simulates the full trajectory of a single particle:

1. A particle is initialized using `new_particle`.
    - ```python
      x, y = self.new_particle()
      steps = 0
      ```
2. The particle undergoes a random walk via repeated calls to `step`.
    - ```python
      while steps < self.max_steps:
        x, y =self.step(x, y)
        steps = steps + 1
      ```
3. At each step:
  - The distance from the cluster center is computed.
    - ```python
      r = np.sqrt((x - self.center)**2 + (y - self.center)**2)
      ```
  - If the particle exceeds the *kill radius*, it is discarded and a new particle is introduced.
    - ```python
      if (r > self.kill_radius):
          x, y = self.new_particle()                      
          steps = 0  
      ```
4. The local neighborhood is evaluated using `neighbor_counter`.
    - ```python
      neighbors = self.neighbor_counter(x, y)
      if neighbors > 0:
        p_stick = 1 - (1 - self.stickiness)**neighbors
        if random.random() < p_stick:
            return x, y
      ```

#### Sticking Condition

If the particle is adjacent to the cluster, the probability of attachment is computed as:

```math
P_{\text{stick}} = 1 - (1 - S)^n
```

where:
- $S$ is the stickiness parameter,
- $n$ is the number of occupied neighboring sites $[0,8]$.

If a uniformly sampled random number satisfies this probability, the particle attaches, and the method returns its coordinates. Otherwise, the walk continues.

If the particle exceeds the maximum allowed steps, the method returns `None`.

---

### `neighbor_counter(self, x, y)`

Counts the number of occupied neighboring lattice sites:

- All 8 surrounding positions are checked.
  - Boundary conditions are enforced to prevent out-of-bounds errors.
  - ```python
    surrounding_pts = [(1,0),(1,-1),(0,-1),(-1,-1),(-1,0),(-1,1),(0,1),(1,1)]
    neighbors = 0
    for dx, dy in surrounding_pts:
        nx, ny = x + dx, y + dy
        if 0 <= nx < self.grid_size and 0 <= ny < self.grid_size:
            if self.grid[nx, ny] > 0:
                neighbors = neighbors + 1
    ```
- The method returns the number of adjacent particles already in the cluster.
  - ```python
    return neighbors
    ```

This value directly influences the sticking probability.

## Cluster Evolution

### `update_cluster_radius(self, x, y)`

Updates the effective radius of the cluster:

- Computes the Euclidean distance of the newly added particle from the center.
  - ```python
    r = np.sqrt((x - self.center)**2 + (y - self.center)**2)
    ```
- If this exceeds the current radius, the cluster radius is updated.
  - The kill radius is also adjusted accordingly.
  - ```python
    if r > self.cluster_radius:
        self.cluster_radius = r
        self.kill_radius    = (self.cluster_radius * 1.25) + 10
    ```

---

### `compute_angular_density(self, n_bins=36)`

To address the issue of anisotropic growth (e.g., large branches or fingers forming off the main cluster), instead of computing an equipotential surface for spawning particles, a method of tracking the **angular density** of particles in the cluster is implemented. Again, the reason behind this biasing is to reverse the bias introduced by a tight spawn radius (which was implemented for computational efficiency). This method computes a histogram of particle density as a function of the angle from the cluster center. The angular density is then used to bias the spawning of new particles, preferentially introducing them in less populated directions to encourage more isotropic growth. This approach is inspired by the concept of *Laplacian growth* and helps mitigate the formation of dominant branches, leading to more balanced cluster morphologies. This improvement allows the function to scale to larger particle counts without encountering problems due to anisotropic growth, which was a major issue in the original implementation.

#### Angular Density Computation

The angular density is computed by mapping each particle in the cluster to an angle relative to the cluster center:
```math
\theta_i = \arctan2(y_i - y_c, x_i - x_c)
```
where $(x_c, y_c)$ is the cluster center and $(x_i, y_i)$ are the coordinates of the $i$-th particle.  

These angles are then binned into a fixed number of angular sectors to form a histogram, representing the relative density $ (\rho(\theta)) $ of particles in each direction. The histogram is normalized such that:
```math
0 \leq \rho(\theta) \leq 1
```

where $ \rho(\theta) = 1 $ corresponds to the most populated angular sector.

The implementation is as follows:

1. The positions of all particles in the cluster are extracted and shifted so that the cluster center is at the origin.
    - ```python
      positions = np.array(self.cluster_particles)
      dx = positions[:,0] - self.center
      dy = positions[:,1] - self.center
      ```

2. The angles are computed using the `arctan2` function, which correctly handles the quadrant of the angle and returns values in the range $[-\pi, \pi]$.
    - ```python
      angles = np.arctan2(dy, dx)
      ```

3. A histogram of angles is created using `numpy.histogram`, which counts the number of particles in each angular bin. The range is set to cover all possible angles, and the number of bins can be adjusted for resolution. Then, `astype(float)` is used to convert the histogram counts to floating-point numbers for subsequent normalization.
    - ```python
      hist, bin_edges = np.histogram(angles, bins=n_bins, range=(-np.pi, np.pi))
      hist = hist.astype(float)
      ```
4. The histogram is normalized to the maximum value to scale it to the range [0,1]. This allows for easy biasing in the particle spawning process, where less populated angles can be given higher probabilities for new particle introduction.
    - ```python
      if hist.max() > 0:
          hist /= hist.max()
      ```

5. The centers of the bins are calculated for use in plotting or biasing new particle angles. The method returns both the normalized histogram and the corresponding bin centers for use in the `new_particle` method.
    - ```python
      bin_centers = 0.5 * (bin_edges[:-1] + bin_edges[1:])
      return hist, bin_centers
      ```

## Fractal Analysis

### `analyze_fractal(self, box_sizes=None)`

This function computes the **global capacity (box-counting) dimension** of the diffusion-limited aggregation cluster. It quantifies how the occupied area of the cluster scales with spatial resolution by counting how many discrete grid boxes are required to fully cover the structure at different length scales.

#### **Box-Counting Procedure**

To estimate the scaling behavior, the cluster is first cropped to its active region using `get_active_region()`, reducing computational overhead and eliminating empty grid space.

The core of the method is a recursive partitioning of the grid into non-overlapping square boxes of side length \( \epsilon \). For each box size, the number of occupied boxes \( N(\epsilon) \) is computed:

- The grid is iterated in steps of `box_size`
- Each subregion is tested for occupancy using `np.any`

```python
if np.any(cluster[i:i+box_size, j:j+box_size] > 0):
    count += 1
```
This produces a discrete estimate of how many boxes are required to cover the cluster at each scale.

#### **Scaling Transformation**
The box-counting dimension is defined through the scaling relation:
```math 
N(\epsilon) \sim \epsilon^{-D}
```
Taking logarithms yields a linear relationship:
```math
\log N(\epsilon) = -D \log \epsilon + C
``` 
where $D$ is the capacity dimension and $C$ is a constant. By plotting $\log N(\epsilon)$ against $\log(1/\epsilon)$, the slope of the resulting line can be estimated using linear regression, providing an estimate of the fractal dimension. 
```python
log_S = np.log(1 / np.array(box_sizes))
log_N = np.log(total_count)
```

#### **Dimension Estimation**
A linear regression is performed in log-log space using np.polyfit, where the slope corresponds directly to the capacity dimension:
```python
m, b = np.polyfit(log_S, log_N, 1)
capacity_dimension = m
```
This yields a single effective fractal dimension describing the global scaling behavior of the cluster.

#### **Output**
- A log-log plot of $ \log N(\epsilon) $ vs $ -\log \epsilon $
- A best-fit linear regression line
- A saved figure (`capacity_dimension.png`) for reference
- The estimated capacity dimension

---

### `CD_vs_radius(self, r_bins=100)`

This function computes the local (scale-dependent) capacity dimension as a function of radial distance from the cluster center. Unlike the global box-counting method, this approach characterizes how fractal scaling behavior changes across different spatial regimes of the aggregate.

#### **Radial Mass Distribution**
- Each particle in the cluster is first mapped to its radial distance from the center:
  - ```python
    dx = positions[:, 0] - self.center
    dy = positions[:, 1] - self.center
    radii = np.sqrt(dx**2 + dy**2)
    ```
- A cumulative mass function $ M(r)$ is then constructed:
  - $ M(r) = \text{\# particles with} r_i \leq r $

#### **Logrithmic Scaling**
- To extract scaling behavior, both radius and mass are transformed into logarithmic space:
  - ```python
    log_r = np.log(r_edges)
    log_M = np.log(M_r + 1e-12)
    ```
      - The small constant is added to avoid issues with $\log(0)$.

#### **Local Dimension Estimation**
- The local fractal dimension is defined as:
  - $    D(r) = \frac{\mathrm{d} \log M(r)}{\mathrm{d} \log r} $
- This derivative is approximated using a finite-difference gradient:
  - ```python
    D_r = np.gradient(log_M, log_r)
    ```

#### **Output**
The resulting curve typically exhibits three regimes:
- Small radii: strong fluctuations due to discrete particle effects
- Intermediate radii: stable scaling region corresponding to true DLA fractal behavior
- Large radii: decay toward zero due to saturation of the cumulative mass function

The function outputs:
- Radial positions $r$ corresponding to the bin edges
- Local capacity dimension $D(r)$, as a function of radius
- A plot of $D(r)$ vs radius, illustrating how the local dimension evolves with distance from the cluster center
- A saved figure (`CD_vs_radius_2.png`) for reference

## Visualization

### `get_active_region(self, whitespace=5)`

(Based on the [Tips and Tricks Markdown](.Notes+tips.md).) Extracts a cropped region of the grid containing the active cluster:
- Determines the bounding box of occupied sites.
- Adds a small buffer region for clarity.
- Returns a reduced grid for efficient visualization.

---

### `animate(self, interval=50, batch=5)`

This method serves as the central driver of the entire simulation. It drives particle generation, random walks, aggregation, visualization, and post-processing into a single cohesive workflow. All previously defined methods (`walk`, `update_cluster_radius`, `get_active_region`, etc.) are ultimately utilized within this function.

---

#### Initialization of Visualization

The method begins by constructing a Matplotlib figure and axis:

- The initial state of the system is obtained using `get_active_region`, which crops the grid to the region containing the active cluster.
- The cluster is rendered using `imshow`, where:
  - A **logarithmic color normalization** (`LogNorm`) is applied to represent the *order of particle deposition*.
  - Instead of mapping the full data range directly, the normalization bounds are determined using **percentile-based scaling**:
    - The lower bound $( v_{\min} )$ is chosen near the 5th percentile of nonzero values.
    - The upper bound $( v_{\max} )$ is chosen near the 98th percentile.
- This adaptive scaling compresses extreme values and expands the mid-range of the distribution, producing a more uniform utilization of the colormap (i.e., improved visibility of intermediate colors such as greens and blues, rather than saturation in red).
- A color bar is added to provide a quantitative reference for deposition order.

This approach ensures that the visualization remains informative throughout the simulation, even as the dynamic range of particle indices grows significantly.

---

#### Particle Tracking

A counter, `particles_added`, is initialized to track the number of particles in the cluster:
- The seed particle is counted as the first particle.
- This variable is updated dynamically during the simulation and is shared with the animation loop via a closure (`nonlocal` keyword).

---

#### Animation Update Loop and Batching

A nested function, `update(frame)`, is defined and passed to `FuncAnimation`. This function is executed once per animation frame and performs the core simulation steps.

To improve computational efficiency, multiple particles are added per frame:
- A loop runs until either:
  - A specified number of particles (`batch`) have been added, or
  - The total particle limit (`max_particles`) is reached.
- For each iteration:
  1. A particle trajectory is simulated using `walk()`.
  2. If the particle successfully sticks:
     - Its position is recorded in the grid using the current deposition index.
     - The particle is appended to the cluster list.
     - The cluster radius is updated via `update_cluster_radius`.

This batching strategy significantly reduces rendering overhead and accelerates the simulation without altering the underlying physics.

---

#### Grid and Visualization Update

After processing the batch:
- The current active region of the cluster is extracted using `get_active_region`.
- The displayed image is updated with the new grid data:
  - `set_data` replaces the pixel values.
  - The logarithmic normalization is recalibrated to reflect the updated maximum deposition index.

The function returns the updated image object, enabling efficient rendering via *blitting*.

---

#### Animation Execution

The animation is created using:
```python
animation.FuncAnimation(...)
```

## Computational Considerations

- **Termination**: The simulation avoids infinite loops using both a maximum step count and a kill radius for particles that wander too far.
- **Stability**: Dynamic adjustment of the cluster and kill radii ensures numerical stability as the aggregate grows.
- **Efficiency**: Batch updates and localized visualization reduce computational overhead for large $N$.

This methodology provides a robust and flexible framework for simulating DLA and extracting its fractal characteristics.

# Results and Discussion

## Branching Instability in Classical DLA

The following animation clearly demonstrates an irritating result of diffusion-limited aggregation: **branching**. Rather than growing uniformly in all directions, the cluster develops a small number of dominant branches that extend rapidly outward, while other regions remain sparsely populated or effectively “screened.”

This behavior arises from the underlying diffusion process. Particles undergoing random walks are more likely to encounter protruding parts of the cluster, since these regions intercept a larger fraction of the diffusive flux. As a result, once a branch begins to extend outward, it preferentially captures additional particles, reinforcing its growth. This feedback mechanism leads to highly anisotropic structures dominated by a few major growth directions. The result is reflective of physical phenomena such as electrodeposition, electrical breakdown (lightning), and other pattern-forming processes. However, the goal is to model more isotropic cluster growth, which is why the biasing mechanism was implemented in the `new_particle` method.

The animation shows this effect clearly:
- Early growth appears relatively symmetric.
- As the cluster expands, small fluctuations are amplified.
- One or more branches begin to dominate, extending significantly farther than the rest of the structure.
- Interior regions become increasingly shielded from incoming particles.

This phenomenon is often referred to as screening, where outer branches block diffusive access to inner regions. Consequently, the growth probability becomes concentrated at the tips of the cluster, leading to the formation of fractal, tree-like structures.

From a computational perspective, this instability is not an artifact of the implementation but a fundamental feature of the DLA model. However, it presents challenges for analysis:
- The cluster becomes highly irregular and anisotropic.
- Measurements such as fractal dimension may exhibit increased variability.
- Visual interpretation becomes dominated by a few extreme features.

Skip through the animation, the branching is evident towards the end of the animation:

</figure>

These observations motivated the introduction of a biasing mechanism in subsequent simulations, with the goal of redistributing particle influx and promoting more uniform growth. The effectiveness and implications of this modification are explored in the following sections.

## Effect of Stickiness on Cluster Morphology

The stickiness parameter $(S)$ plays a crucial role in determining the morphology of the resulting DLA clusters. By controlling the probability that a particle will adhere to the cluster upon contact, varying $S$ allows us to explore a spectrum of growth behaviors, from highly branched and tenuous structures at high stickiness to denser and more compact aggregates at low stickiness. Lower stickiness values introduce additional stochasticity in the attachment process, which can lead to more isotropic growth and reduced branching. Conversely, higher stickiness values promote rapid attachment at the first point of contact, reinforcing the formation of dominant branches. The following animations illustrate the effect of varying the stickiness parameter on cluster morphology for a simulation with 10,000 particles:

## Capacity Dimension

### Capacity Dimension vs Topological Dimension
The **topological dimension** of a set is an integer quantity that describes how many independent coordinates are required to specify a point within the object. For example, a line has topological dimension 1, a plane has dimension 2, and a volume has dimension 3. The topological dimension does **not** describe the complexity or scaling properties of a structure, but rather its fundamental geometric nature. 

In contrast, the **capacity (box-counting) dimension** is a fractal measure that quantifies how the number of boxes required to cover a set scales with the resolution of that covering. For a fractal set, this scaling follows:
```math
N(\epsilon) \sim \epsilon^{-D}
```

where $N(\epsilon)$ is the number of boxes of side length $\epsilon$ required to cover the structure, and $D$ is the capacity dimension.

In this simulation, the capacity dimension was computed using a box-counting algorithm applied to the discrete particle grid representation of the DLA cluster. By comparing the scaling of occupied boxes across multiple length scales, an effective fractal dimension was extracted via a linear fit in log–log space.

Unlike the topological dimension, the capacity dimension of DLA clusters is non-integer, which explains their complex, self-similar nature. The capacity dimension provides insight into the degree of branching and density of the aggregate, while the topological dimension simply indicates that the cluster exists in a two-dimensional space.

---

### Capacity Dimension of Witten and Sander's Original DLA
Witten and Sander reported a fractal dimension of $D \approx 1.65$ for two-dimensional DLA clusters. This value was obtained through random particle diffusion and random walking. It is consistent with the observed scaling behavior of the mass distribution in the clusters. 

The capacity dimension captures how the number of occupied boxes scales with box size and provides a quantitative measure of the cluster’s geometric complexity. The expected capacity dimension for a DLA simulation is approximately 1.65, which reflects the highly branched and tenuous nature of the aggregates formed under diffusion-limited conditions.

  <figcaption><strong>Figure 4.</strong> Capacity dimension of the DLA cluster calculated using box-counting methods (stickiness parameter S = 0.5).</figcaption>
</figure>

The capacity dimension calculated from this simulation is **$D = 1.551$**, which was fairly close to the expected result of $D \approx 1.65$. The number of particles in the cluster was only 10,000, which is small enough to produce noticeable differences. Additionally, the biasing mechanism implemented to promote isotropic growth may have influenced the morphology of the cluster and thus its fractal properties. Further simulations with larger particle counts and varying stickiness parameters are needed to fully explore these effects and confirm the relationship between stickiness and capacity dimension. For example, the following simulation shows the capacity dimension for a 64,000 particle cluster with a low stickiness parameter of $S = 0.1$. The capacity dimension for this cluster was calculated to be $D = 1.$, which is much closer to the expected value of $D \approx 1.65$.

### Capacity Dimension as a Function of Stickiness
As discussed earlier, the stickiness parameter $(S)$ controls the probability that a diffusing particle adheres upon contact with the aggregate. This parameter directly influences the morphology of the cluster and, therefore, its fractal dimension. Lower stickiness values allow particles to explore deeper into the cluster interior before attaching, producing denser and more space-filling structures. Higher stickiness leads to immediate attachment upon contact, favoring highly branched, tenuous structures dominated by tip growth.

To quantify this effect, the capacity dimension was computed for clusters generated under varying values of $S$. The results show the relationship between stickiness and fractal dimension, with lower stickiness values yielding higher capacity dimensions (closer to the expected $D \approx 1.65$) and higher stickiness values resulting in lower capacity dimensions due to increased branching and reduced density.

The results indicate a weak inverse correlation between stickiness and capacity dimension within the parameter range studied. Higher stickiness values produce more branched clusters with reduced effective dimensionality, while lower stickiness yields comparatively denser aggregates.

### Capacity Dimension as a Function of Radial Distance
The capacity dimension can also be analyzed as a function of radial distance from the cluster center. This approach involves calculating the mass distribution $M(r)$ within concentric circles of increasing radius and examining how it scales with $r$. The local fractal dimension can be estimated using the relation:
```math
D(r) = \frac{\mathrm{d} \log M(r)}{\mathrm{d} \log r}
```

The results observed in the two “capacity dimension as a function of radius” graphs are consistent with the structure of the function `CD_vs_radius()`. The initial sharp increase in $D(r)$ occurs because, at small radii, the cumulative particle count $(M(r))$ grows rapidly in a discrete and highly sensitive regime. In this region, logarithmic differentiation amplifies small changes in particle number, producing large fluctuations in the estimated dimension.

The intermediate region, where $D(r)$ fluctuates approximately between 1.5 and 1.9, corresponds to the physically meaningful scaling regime of the DLA cluster. In this range, the aggregate exhibits approximate self-similarity, and the relationship $M(r) \sim r^D$ is most valid. This is the region that should be used for comparison with theoretical values such as the Witten–Sander result $D \approx 1.65$.

As the radius approaches its maximum value, the estimated dimension decreases toward zero. This behavior is not indicative of a physical change in the cluster but instead arises from saturation of the cumulative mass function. Near the outer boundary of the aggregate, $M(r)$ approaches the total number of particles and becomes effectively constant. Consequently, the derivative $d\log M / d\log r$ tends toward zero, since additional increases in radius no longer correspond to significant increases in enclosed mass.

# Extension: DLA Animation for $1e6$ Particles
To further explore the behavior of DLA clusters at larger scales, an animation was generated for a simulation with 1 million particles. This extension provides insights into how the branching instability and fractal properties evolve as the cluster size increases.
### Limit of Local Computing Resources
Below is the animation limit of a common laptop. Left running overnight, for about 12 hours, the simulation was able to generate a cluster with a little over 300,000 particles.
